<h1 id="supported-plugins">Supported plugins</h1>
<p>Cacti group has developed and is still developing a large number of plugins extending cacti. Some of them are adopted from the community.</p>
<p>Of course plugins can be developed by anyone, our documentation contains everything needed. We do our best to keep the plugins we support working with current versions of cacti.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the plugins we support and a short description of them.</p>

<li><p><strong>Servcheck</strong></p>
<p>Internet services (http, imap, ldap, ...) monitoring plugin. This plugin allows you to add service monitoring to Cacti. You simply add service check, allow service specific test (like certificate test) and you can add the expected response. Servcheck periodically runs test and notifies if a service check fails. The plugin records statistics about the connection, it's response, and can alert when the status changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>tests for scp, tftp, ftp, smb, ..</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Cacti/plugin_hmib">Hmib plugin homepage</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weathermap</strong></p>
<p>Weathermap is one of many implementations of the same basic idea - take data from your network devices and use it to provide a single-page overview of the current state of network, like the one to the right.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Cacti/plugin_weathermap">Weathermap plugin homepage</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Syslog</strong></p>
<p>It provides a simple Syslog event search an Alert generation and notification interface that can generate both HTML and SMS messages for operations personnel who wish to receive notifications inside of a data or network operations center. When combined by the Linux SNMPTT package, it can be converted into an SNMP Trap and Inform receiver and notification engine as the SNMPTT tool will receive SNMP Traps and Informs and convert them into Syslog messages on your log server. These syslog messages can then be consumed by the syslog plugin. So, this tool is quite handy</p>
<ul>
<li>Message filtering</li>
<li>Message searching</li>
<li>Message Alerting</li>
<li>Alert Methods of Individual and Threshold Based</li>
<li>Remote Log Server connection capabilities</li>

<li>Ability to run alert specific commands at Alert and Re-alert times</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Cacti/plugin_syslog">Syslog plugin homepage</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slowlog</strong></p>
<p>The plugin will allow a Cacti Administrator to import their slow Query log and perform analysis of that slow log.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Cacti/plugin_slowlog">Slowlog plugin homepage</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apcupsd</strong></p>
<p>This plugin is to be used to track UPS status from the apcupsd daemon as well as SNMP enabled UPS. The apcupsd daemon is able to provide information on APC and other types of UPS' over various network typologies such as USB, Modbus, Ethernet, etc. We have added basic SNMP support in order to provide direct access to certain models over the SNMP protocol thus removing the need for an apcupsd host to provide the monitoring details as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Track UPS status</li>
<li>Log information to Cacti database</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Cacti/plugin_apcupsd">Apcupsd plugin homepage</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>WMI</strong></p>
<p>The WMI Plugin provides data collection services for devices that support the WMI protocol. It operates asyncrhonously to the Cacti data collection and stores the resulting information into cache tables. These cache tables can then be used to generate graphs, thresholds and alerts. It relies on the 'wmic' command in Linux, and WMI services via Microsofts COM protocol from Windows Cacti servers.</p>

</ul>
